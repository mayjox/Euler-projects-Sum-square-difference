# Euler-projects-Sum-square-difference
Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.

# About The Project

Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that will require more than just mathematical insights to solve. https://projecteuler.net/

This is the sixth problem in the series. The challenge was to Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.

# Built with:

The solution was built with Javascript ES6. Javascript concepts used:

for loop

# What I learned:

I am learning how to write efficient code that uses less computing power.

The need to be creative in solving problems.

reinforcing knowledge with practise.
